Hello! I am Tunde, a reesearch student at [Insight Centre](https://www.insight-centre.org/), Data Science Institute, University of Galway, Ireland. 

My work and research
======

My research is in Natural Language Processing. My recent projects include dialogue and translation tasks.


My background and history
======

I earned my Master's in Computer Science from [African University of Science and Technology, Abuja](https://aust.edu.ng). I participated in the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org) programme at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Ghana. I also worked remotely as a NLP Engineer with [Proto](https://www.proto.cx/), an AI company that use chatbots to improve customer experience. My undergraduate programme was in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Federal University of Technology, Minna.

My intellectual communities
======

I belong to some super cool groups - Black in AI, [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), AI Saturdays Abuja, International Society for Knowledge Organisation, West Africa [(ISKO-WA)](https://www.isko.org/). I also belong to some communities, trying to contribute to social good in my own little way. I have participated in many conferences/workshops/summits, mostly virtual.
